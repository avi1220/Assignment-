1-A) Yes

2-A) Red

3-B) They cannot be used when the data is not completely linearly separable while allowing no errors
    C) They are not optimal to use in case of outliers

4-D) All of the above

5-A) Yes

6-A) They are less sensitive to outliers and can be used even in their presence
    B) They make sure that there is no data point present in the margin area
    D) They can be used in case data is not completely linearly separable

7-A) They take the data from lower dimensional space to some higher dimensional space in case the data is not  likely to be linearly separable
    B) They use the kernel tricks to escape the complex computations required to transform the data

8-B) We have to first convert the whole data in to the higher dimensional space before applying the kernel function
   C) The data product values given by the kernel functions are used to find the classifier in the higher dimensional space.

9-C) It is a model trained using supervised learning. It can be used for classification and regression.

10-D) All of the above
