1-A) SVMs use hyperplanes as decision boundary for classification.
    B) SVMs uses kernel functions to avoid computational load of converting the whole dataset in to higher
          dimensional space where the data is linearly separable.
   D) SVMs use hard margin classifier.

2-A) Red

3-A) The RBF is used to find the linear classifier for the data in to infinite dimensional space.
   C) A very high value of gamma may lead to overfitting.

4-B) A Soft Margin Linear classifier

5-B) The margin width will Increase
   C) There will be no effect on the margin 
   D) The classifier will become non linear

6-A) Figure A

7-C) D3>D2>D1

8-C) Gamma2 > Gamma 1

9-B) The model would consider only the points close to the hyperplane for modelling

10-A) A large number of misclassification would happen
