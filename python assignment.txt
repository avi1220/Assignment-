Answer11
List:- 
1. Lists are used to store an indexed list of items.
2. A list created by squared brackets with commas separating items.
3. Lists are ordered and mutable.
Tuple:-
1. Tuples are similar to list except they are immutable.
2. Tuple created using ()
3. Tuples are ordered and immutable.
Set:-
1. Sets are data structures similar to lists.
2. Set can be created using set() or {}
3. Sets are unordered and mutable.
Dictionary:-
1. Dictionaries are data structures used to map arbitrary keys to values.
2. Dictionary can be created using {}.
3. Dictionary is unordered and mutable.

Answer12
No, strings are not mutable in python.
Program:-
a= "I+LOVE+PYTHON"
new = a.replace("+", " ")
print(new)

Answer13
The ord() function returns the number representing the unicode code of a specified character.
Example:-
Return the integer that represents the character "a" i.e., 97:

x = ord("a")

To get the datatype of a variable, we use type() function
Example:-
x = ord("a")
type(x)
output:- <class 'int'>

Answer14
program:-
import cmath
a= int(input("Enter the Number: "))
b= int(input("Enter the Number: "))
c= int(input("Enter the Number: "))
d= (b**2)-(4*a*c)
sol1 = (-b-cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)
sol2 = (-b+cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)
print('The solution are {0} and {1}'.format(sol1,sol2))

Answer15
import math

a = int(input("Enter the coefficients of a: "))
b= int(input("Enter the coefficients of b: "))
c= int(input("Enter the coefficients of c: "))
d = (b**2)-(4*a*c)
if d < 0:
    print("This equation has no real solution")
elif d == 0:
    x = (-b+math.sqrt(b**2-4*a*c))/2*a
    print("This equation has one solutions: ", x)
else:
    x1 = (-b+math.sqrt(b**2-4*a*c))/2*a
    x2 = (-b-math.sqrt(b**2-4*a*c))/2*a
    print("This equation has two solutions: ", x1, " and", x2)
